# Sprint 2 retrospective (focus on how we worked as a team/the process)

## What went well

- Better distribution of the work so that everybody had a chance to do a bit of everything.
- Spent time live coding together via Google Hangout
- Starting to get the hang of GitHub
- Useful daily stand up meetings via whatsapp
- Made use of team members that were available at a given time (ie not waiting for all four of us)
- Better communcation of issues, tasks and knowledge



## How it might have gone better

- Use of estimation in forward planning of sprint
- Use of Scrum Master for estimations, understanding backlog etc.

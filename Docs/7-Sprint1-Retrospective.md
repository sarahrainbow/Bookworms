# Sprint 1 retrospective

## What went well

- Managed to get all the parts of the exercise completed
- Made a good start on normalisation



## How it might have gone better

- Collaborated more effectively so everyone was involved with each major element of the exercise
- Done more work on normalisation
- Having a scrum master might have helped keep a better view of the project as whole and made sure we were on track/collaborating effectively
- Integrating more scrum rituals into our sprint e.g. daily stand-up, sprint planning to ensure we were working in the most Agile way possible

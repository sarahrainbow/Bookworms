# Sprint 1 retrospective

## What went well

- Managed to get all the parts of the exercise completed
- Made a good start on normalisation
- Comprehensive database 
- Thoroughtly thought about all the features that our users might want to have



## How it might have gone better

- Collaborated more effectively so everyone was involved with each major element of the exercise
- Done more work on normalisation
- Having a scrum master might have helped keep a better view of the project as whole and made sure we were on track/collaborating effectively
- Integrating more scrum rituals into our sprint e.g. daily stand-up, sprint planning to ensure we were working in the most Agile way possible



## Other observations
- GitHub is providing us with an additional learning curve - I think it would be good to monitor whether it's adding to or detracting from our project and how we are each individually learning as time goes on. There is also a danger that we start commiting changes to files separately and in turn diverge from the strong collaborative focus that Victoria wants us to have.

# Scrum rituals

### 1. Sprint planning (kick-off)

#### What can be done this Sprint?

A time to decide what is achievable within this sprint, what work we can commit to.

1. Create tickets in product backlog

2. Decide which tickets should be put into the Sprint backlog

3. Order them in Trello according to MoSCoW



### 2. Daily stand-up

2. What we plan to do today
3. What impedes us



### 3. Sprint review

- Present our work to Victoria

- Discuss the process we went though 

- Receive feedback



### 4. Sprint retrospective

2. Look for improvements

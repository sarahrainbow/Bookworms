# Bookworms

Welcome to the Bookworms Library app!

1. [Application Requirements](/Docs/1-ApplicationRequirements.md)

Here we outline the requirements our application must fulfil. 

2. [User stories](/Docs/2-UserStories.md)

Our user stories helped shape our application requirements.

3. [Example Database](/Docs/4-ExampleTables.xlsx)

From our appication requirements and user stories, we had enough information to create an example database.

4. [The SQL Database itself](bookwormsLibrary.sql)

With our example database as a reference, we then created the actual database using MySQL.

5. [Library Application Schema](/Docs/5-LibraryApplicationSchema.md)

Here we outline the one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships in our database.
